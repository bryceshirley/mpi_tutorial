"""
2. Deadlock Example (Recv-before-Send Circular Wait)
----------------------------------------------------

Two students wait to *receive* each other's papers before sending their own.
Since nobody sends first, both wait forever.

=> Both call Recv() before Send(), so neither side can proceed.

To run:
    mpirun -n 2 python3 4_deadlock_sendrecv.py

Try fixing it:
    - Have one process send first, then receive
    - Or use Sendrecv() to swap data safely
